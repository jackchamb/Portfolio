# Portfolio
i started this website off the html baseplate, then added the required coresponding links, title, and meta elements.
i broke down the website at the start using header, section, and footer elements.
Included classes to work directly with key elements in my website.
website includes hyper links for nav section, "github", and linkln.
website includes previous work/projects and clicking "view work" shows work.
